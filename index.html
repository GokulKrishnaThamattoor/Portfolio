      <h1 class="headings">Bachelors</h1>
      <p>I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from Agni College of Technology in 2021, with a CGPA of 7.67 and a First Class. I chose to pursue this course because I have always been passionate about how technology works and wanted to develop my skills in this field. During my studies, I gained a solid foundation in computer science principles and learned to design, develop and maintain software applications. The program also helped me to develop problem-solving and analytical skills, which are essential in the field of computer science. I am proud of my academic achievements and look forward to applying my knowledge and skills to achieve my personal and professional goals.</p>

      <h1 class="headings">Schooling</h1>
      <p>I completed my higher secondary education at Vana Vani Matriculation Higher Secondary School, IIT Campus, Chennai, from 2015-2017. During my time in school, I developed many skills, and the experience helped shape me into the person I am today. I was initially an introverted student, but with the support of my teachers and classmates, I was able to come out of my shell and become more confident. In my 10th-grade board exam, I achieved an 81% score, and in my higher secondary exam in 12th grade, I scored 63%.

My school was located in one of the topmost campuses in India and had a beautiful natural forest-like environment.</p>

    <h1 class="headings">Vehicle Speed Detection Using OpenCV</h1>
    <p>This system detects the speed of a vehicle in real-time using the OpenCV library. It can monitor a vehicle using a live camera or the IP address of a camera. The system captures a snapshot of the vehicle and uses image processing techniques to determine the vehicle's speed. This project can improve road safety by detecting speeding vehicles</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box1">
    <h1 class="headings">Emotion Detection Using Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>This system detects the emotions of multiple people in a live frame using the OpenCV library and the Haar-Cascade algorithm. The system captures a live video or image using a camera, and a region of interest is bounded around each person's face. The Haar-Cascade algorithm is used to detect the emotions of each person. This project can be used in marketing research, security, and human-computer interaction</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box1">
    <h1 class="headings">Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Facial Recognition</h1>
    <p>This system detects the drowsiness of a driver using the OpenCV library and machine learning algorithms. It uses a live webcam to monitor the driver's face, eyes, and mouth in real-time. An alarm is triggered when the driver yawns or closes their eyes for a specific time period, indicating that the driver is drowsy. The location of the drowsy driver is fed into the system for emergency contact. This project can improve road safety and prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue</p>

    <h1 class="headings">Portfolio Webiste Using Html and Css</h1>
    <p>Created and designed a portfolio website using HTML and CSS,the page contain basic information about me with my projects with my  social media detail and yet to be hosted on GitPages:https://gokulkrishnathamattoor.github.io/Portfolio/. </p></div>
    <div class="box1">
    <h1 class="headings">WhatsApp Web Automation</h1>
    <p>This automation system for WhatsApp web uses Python and the Selenium web driver. It sends bulk messages to contacts stored in an excel sheet or another form of a database file. This project can save time and effort in sending messages to multiple contacts simultaneously</p>
